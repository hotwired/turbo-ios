# Quick Start Guide

This is a quick start guide to creating the most minimal Turbo iOS application from scratch get up and running in a few minutes. This will support basic back/forward navigation, but will not be a fully functional application.

1. First, create a new iOS app from the Xcode File > New > Project menu and choose the default iOS "App" template. Note: When using XCode >= 12, be sure to choose "Storyboard" under "Interface" and "UIKit App Delegate" under "Lifecycle" in the project creation dialog. 

2. Select your app's main top-level project, go to the Swift Packages tab and add the Turbo iOS dependency by entering in `https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios`.

3. Open the `SceneDelegate`, and replace the entire file with this code:
```swift
import UIKit
import Turbo

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    private lazy var navigationController = UINavigationController()

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        guard let _ = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
        window!.rootViewController = navigationController
        visit(url: URL(string: "https://turbo-native-demo.glitch.me")!)
    }
    
    private func visit(url: URL) {
        let viewController = VisitableViewController(url: url)
        navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
        session.visit(viewController)
    }
    
    private lazy var session: Session = {
        let session = Session()
        session.delegate = self
        return session
    }()
}

extension SceneDelegate: SessionDelegate {
    func session(_ session: Session, didProposeVisit proposal: VisitProposal) {
        visit(url: proposal.url)
    }
    
    func session(_ session: Session, didFailRequestForVisitable visitable: Visitable, error: Error) {
        print("didFailRequestForVisitable: \(error)")
    }
    
    func sessionWebViewProcessDidTerminate(_ session: Session) {
        session.reload()
    }
}
```

4. Hit run, and you have a basic working app. You can now tap links and navigate the demo back and forth in the simulator. We've only touched the very core requirements here of creating a `Session` and handling a visit.

5. You can change the url we use for the initial visit to your web app. Note: if you're running your app locally without https, you'll need to adjust your `NSAppTransportSecurity` settings in the Info.plist to allow arbitrary loads.

6. A real application will want to customize the view controller, respond to different visit actions, gracefully handle errors, and build a more powerful routing system. Read the rest of the documentation to learn more.
